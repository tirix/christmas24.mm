## ADVENT OF METAMATH 2024! ##

Programmers have a nice tradition of solving a small puzzle or coding task on each day of advent, Advent of Code being one of the most famous examples. 

[This year's challenge](https://groups.google.com/g/metamath/c/S9zHruNKjAs/m/QFmdKEqvAQAJ) is to prove [a set of 16 small results about magmas](https://gist.github.com/savask/f7a3b46663aa16e5dd48f8bfaba3e3e5), some of them appearing in the Putnam exam,
one being the famous [Eckmann-Hilton argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckmann%E2%80%93Hilton_argument),
while the last one is the result of Mendelsohn and Padmanabhan, that a certain identity characterizes boolean groups.

Since most of those results concern universal algebra, not all of them are formulated in terms of set.mm's magma structure ` Mgm ` ,
but it should be fairly easy to convert them to that form if needed.
Have fun!
