## ADVENT OF METAMATH 2024! ##

The task is to prove several results about magmas, some of them appearing in the Putnam exam,
one being the famous [Eckmann-Hilton argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckmann%E2%80%93Hilton_argument),
while the last one is the result of Mendelsohn and Padmanabhan, that a certain identity characterizes boolean groups.

Since most of those results concern universal algebra, not all of them are formulated in terms of set.mm's magma structure ` Mgm ` ,
but it should be fairly easy to convert them to that form if needed.
Have fun!
